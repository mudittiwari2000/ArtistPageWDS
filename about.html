    <p>Linkin Park is an American rock band from Agoura Hills, California. They started making music in 1996, the band
      became very famous with their first album, Hybrid Theory, which was labeled with the Diamond Award of more than 10
      million copies by the RIAA and multi-platinum in several other countries. Their second album, Meteora,
      continued the band's popularity, reaching number one at the Billboard 200 album chart in 2003. It was promoted
      with concerts and giving for charities around the world. In 2003, MTV2 called Linkin Park the sixth greatest
      band of the music video time and the third best band of the new millennium, only beaten by Oasis and Coldplay.
      Billboard ranked Linkin Park #19 on the Best Artists of the Decade (Past 10 Years) chart.

      The band used the genres nu metal and rap metal to make it suitable for radio yet heavy in layers in Hybrid Theory
      and Meteora. The band used other types of music in their next studio album Minutes to Midnight, which was
      released in 2007. The album also reached number one at the Billboard and had the third best beginning at
      number one of any album that year. The band also worked with other artists and bands. The most famous
      would be rapper Jay-Z in their mash-up (mixing more than one song together) extended play Collision Course and
      many other people on their remix album Reanimation. The band's album, A Thousand Suns, was released on 2010.
      They further changed their sound again. Linkin Park have sold more than 50 million albums all over the world and
      have won two Grammys</p>
